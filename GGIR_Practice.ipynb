    "## Overview\n",
    "The below code offers an overview of the GGIR R package, and, more importantly, runs a sample processing pipeline on a single participant from AHAB. The general structue of the below GGIR code is stable but small details/specifications are likely to update as we get closer to being ready to screen. \n",

    "## Basics of GGIR\n",
    "\n",
    "[GGIR](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GGIR) is an R-package to process multi-day raw accelerometer data for physical activity and sleep research. The signal processing includes automatic calibration, detection of sustained abnormally high values, detection of non-wear and calculation of average magnitude of dynamic acceleration based on a variety of metrics. Next, GGIR uses this information to describe the data per recording, per day of measurement, and (optionally) per segment of a day of measurement, including estimates of physical activity, inactivity and sleep.\n",
    "See overview paper of GGIR from 2019: [link](https://doi.org/10.1123/jmpb.2018-0063).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "GGIR works with with many accelerometer brands and formats, including ActiGraph. [ActiGraph](https://actigraphcorp.com/) .csv and .gt3x files are both compatable (the below code uses the .gt3x file)\n",
    "\n",
    "All accelerometer data that needs to be analysed should be stored in one folder, or subfolders of that folder.\n"

    "## GGIR shell function\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5 key parts relevant for processing and scoring the actigraphy data in GGIR:\n",
    "- Part 1: Loads the data and stores derived features (aggregations) needed for the other parts. Delects nonware times. This is the time-consuming part (80% of processing time taken up in this step) \n",
    "- Part 2: Data quality analyses and low-level description of signal features per day and per file. At this point a day is defined from midnight to midnight\n",
    "- Part 3: Estimation of sustained inactivity and sleep periods, needed for input to Part 4 for sleep detection\n",
    "- Part 4: Labels the sustained inactive periods detected in Part 3 as sleep, or daytime sustained inactivity, per night and per file\n",
    "- Part 5: Derives sleep and physical activity characteristics by re-using information derived in part 2, 3 and 4. Total time in intensity categories, the number of bouts, time spent in bouts and average acceleration (overall activity) is calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why it split up in parts is that it avoids having the re-do all analysis if you only want to make a small change in the more downstream parts. The specific order and content of the parts has grown for historical and computational reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ease interacting with GGIR there is one central function, named `g.shell.GGIR`, that incorporates all other functions."
